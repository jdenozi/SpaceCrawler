## Getting started

1. Create a new repo by clicking `Use this template` up to the right!
2. Download some [GLFW pre-compiled binaries](https://www.glfw.org/download) and put the `libglfw3.a` file in `libs/glfw/`.
3. Compile with CMake and then run it! Piece of cake!


## Remarks

* Uses [imgui version 1.83](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.83)
* Has only been tested on MingW64 compiler for Windows (so it may require some fixing for it to work for gcc or clang)
